This is a collection of missions by Bullet Magnet. As I am in the process of organizing missions for my group, this repo will be a place I host and organize my work. All missions, unless stated otherwise, are made by me. Many are in various states of working well in DCS so feel free to use them but know some "features" might not work perfectly. 


To-do: 
* <del>Change repo name</del> 
* Create organization by mod
* create list of commonly used scripts
